Bayesian inference treats both observed data and parameters as random variables with probability distributions, in contrast to the frequentist approach. Bayesian inference typically begins with prior beliefs or knowledge about the controlling parameters. For instance, in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, one might assume a prior probability distribution for the parameter p such as a uniform distribution. The likelihood function quantifies the probability of observing the data with a specific set of controlling parameters and often relies on certain assumptions. For example, it might be described by a binomial distribution with the controlling parameter p in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. The posterior probability represents the updated beliefs about controlling parameters after integrating the observed data. It can then be employed as the new prior for subsequent observations, enabling the continuous refinement of beliefs in the presence of additional data.
