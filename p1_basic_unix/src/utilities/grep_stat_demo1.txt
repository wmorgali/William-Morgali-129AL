The frequentist uses the concept of frequency or repeated sampling. It focuses on estimating statistical parameters, e.g. means and variances and making statistical inferences based on the given data. In frequentist statistics, parameters governing the underlying distribution are treated as fixed, unknown values, and the goal is to estimate these parameters using point estimates (e.g., maximum likelihood) or confidence intervals. For example, in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the underlining distribution is \textit{assumed} to be the binomial distribution and the controlling parameter is A. The frequentist approach does not incorporate prior beliefs on the parameter p (it is given and fixed), and it relies solely on the data at hand.
